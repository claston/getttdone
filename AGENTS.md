## Working Agreement

This document defines the default execution rules for the `gettdone` repository.

## Branching Rules

1. Always update local `main` from `origin/main` before starting a new task.
2. Always create a new branch for any code or documentation change.
3. Branches should stay focused on one objective.

## Development Rules

1. Prefer TDD for implementation work:
   - write or update tests first
   - run tests and confirm failure when appropriate
   - implement the change
   - run tests again and confirm success
2. Keep refactors incremental and verifiable.
3. Use Conventional Commits for every commit.
4. Always run Python tooling through project virtual environment (`venv\Scripts\python.exe`) when available.
5. Keep V1 architecture aligned with product constraints:
   - single-page flow
   - no login/dashboard in MVP
   - upload -> processing -> preview -> report download

## Production Compatibility Rules

1. Assume the application is already deployed in production.
2. Every change must consider backward compatibility with the currently running production version.
3. Database changes must be backward-compatible by default:
   - prefer additive migrations (new tables/columns/indexes) over destructive changes
   - avoid removing or renaming columns/tables used by existing code paths without a phased rollout
   - when a breaking schema change is unavoidable, document and implement a safe migration/rollback plan
4. For migrations affecting existing data or behavior, include explicit validation steps for upgrade and rollback safety.

## Validation Rules

1. Always run test suite before finalizing work.
2. Always run lint checks when configured.
3. For API changes, run the app and validate endpoints with real HTTP requests.

Minimum API validation for V1:

- one `POST /analyze` happy path with supported file (`CSV`, `XLSX`, or `OFX`)
- one `GET /report/{analysis_id}` happy path
- one negative-path request (`invalid file`, `unsupported format`, or `expired/nonexistent analysis_id`)

When reconciliation logic changes, include at least one validation case for:

- internal transfer match
- reversal/storno match
- possible duplicate grouping

## Delivery Rules

1. Push the branch after tests pass.
2. Open Pull Request using `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
3. PR body sections are mandatory and must be completed with concrete data:
   - `## Summary`
   - `## Why`
   - `## Type of change`
   - `## How to test`
   - `## Data / storage impact`
   - `## Checklist`
   - `## Risks and rollback`
4. If a PR is opened outside template standard, edit the existing PR before finalizing.
5. Prefer opening/editing PRs with:
   - `gh pr create --body-file .github/pull_request_template.md`
   - `gh pr edit <number> --body-file <filled_body_file>`
6. Include command outputs in `How to test` whenever possible.
7. Do not merge directly into `main`.

## Migration PR Checklist

For any PR that changes database schema, include this checklist in the PR body and fill with concrete evidence:

- [ ] Migration is additive or proven safe for backward compatibility with production.
- [ ] Existing API/worker code remains compatible during rollout window (before and after deploy).
- [ ] Destructive operations (DROP/RENAME/type narrowing) are avoided; if unavoidable, phased plan is documented.
- [ ] Forward path validated: migration runs successfully in a production-like environment.
- [ ] Rollback path documented and tested (or explicitly marked as not reversible with mitigation).
- [ ] Data backfill/migration strategy documented (if applicable), including idempotency and retry safety.
- [ ] Runtime impact assessed (locks, long transactions, index build strategy, expected downtime = none/minimal).
- [ ] Monitoring/alerts and post-deploy verification steps are defined.
